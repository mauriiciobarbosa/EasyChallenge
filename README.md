## Overview

The architecture used in this project was BLoc + repository pattern. I used two Cubits, one for the form screen, with the field's state, and another for the result screen, with the loading, success and error states. The navigation between those screens was made using the `pushNamed` method and a route defined in the `routes` attributes from the `MaterialApp`.

The repository pattern was used to encapsulate the knowledge of the data source and a special tratement of the data. Futhermore, I used a mix of the feature by package (ex.: `screens` package) and feature by type (ex.: `components` and `data` packages).

Finally, I added local tests with the main purpose of validate the repository behaviour and some utility functions. The widget tests were introduced to validate the form and result screens.
